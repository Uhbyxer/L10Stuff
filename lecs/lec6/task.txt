Task

1.

Read recommended sources.

2.

Study hashmap in detail - how to redefine hashcode and equals, how the
data storage works.

Create console menu using enums.

3.

Create a container that encapsulates an array of String, and that only
adds Strings and gets Strings, so that there are no casting issues during
use. If the internal array isn’t big enough for the next add, your container
should automatically resize it. In main( ), compare the performance of your
container with an ArrayList holding Strings.

4.

Create a class containing two String objects and make it Comparable so
that the comparison only cares about the first String. Fill an array and
an ArrayList with objects of your class by using a custom generator (eg,
which generates pairs of Country-Capital). Demonstrate that sorting works
properly. Now make a Comparator that only cares about the second String
and demonstrate that sorting works properly. Also perform a binary search
using your Comparator.

5.

Ñreate a Deque class and test it.
